# For a brief introduction, this is a whole project that designed as a tool of the DMC tool set.
# This tool will be finally designed as a tool that encapsulated the whole simulation flow in HardWare 
# Front-End.
# So, first of all, this tool will achieve whole features related to verify simulation. Including the
# following features:
# -- environment setting, containing the server ENV and the project ENV.
# -- filelist auto generation.
# -- RTL, ENV and simulation module compilation.
# -- logical behavior simulation for ASIC, FPGA and GATE modes.
# -- wave vision support.
# -- coverage collection and statistics
